# thesis-rpi-sensor-signal-project
My Bachelor's thesis project was about real-time measurement and analysis of utility frequency alternating current signal. The data collection based on a generator, ADC and Raspberry Pi. RPI ran a Python script which saved the incoming data to a CSV. Later on, the data was transferred to a PC where it was analyzed with Matlab using wavelet functions and Fourier transform.

In the project I have included the thesis document (in Estonian), Python script (RPI), Matlab script (PC) and data which was collected.
